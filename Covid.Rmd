### This is the code for reading in the new tidy format coronavirus data

### Setting Everything Up

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
library(geojsonio)
library(tmap)
```

```{r dataSetup}
#load covid data from the UK Government Website
COVID_MSOA <- read_csv("https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/downloads/msoa_data/MSOAs_latest.csv")

##replace NA valut to 0

COVID_MSOA[is.na(COVID_MSOA)] <- 0

#add in week number information according to date 
COVID_MSOA$week<-paste("wk_",strftime(COVID_MSOA$date, format = "%V"),sep="")

# test whetherthe week column is created right or wrong:40 (between 28 September and 4 October 2020)
unique(COVID_MSOA[COVID_MSOA$week=="wk_40",]$date)

#*Data Cleaning Task
#*
#*Think about how we could useful re-code -99 
#*which currently codes cases between 0-2
#*it might be that a new re-coded column is created in the
#*long tidy version of the data

#get some boundaries
#super-generalised url to geojson
url <- "https://opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/87aa4eb6393644768a5f85929cc704c2_0.geojson"

#read those boundaries into an sf() object for plotting
UK_MSOA_sf <- geojson_sf(url)
```

### Joining boundaries and data together

```{r mapJoin}
#join the MSOA boundaries to the data
MSOA_COVID_Map <- UK_MSOA_sf %>% 
  merge(.,
        COVID_MSOA,
        by.x="MSOA11CD",
        by.y="areaCode")

```
## First Test Map

```{r quickMap, echo=FALSE}
#make a very quick and dirty interactive map of week 41

MSOA_COVID_Map_wk41<-MSOA_COVID_Map[MSOA_COVID_Map$week=="wk_41",]

tmap_mode("view")
tm_shape(MSOA_COVID_Map_wk41) +
  tm_fill(col = "newCasesBySpecimenDateRollingSum", style="jenks")
```
